# Telling Your Story

## Objectives
* To begin thinking about your professional story - who you are, where you are coming from, how you got here, and what you want to do next.
* Identify specific skills and value you can contribute to a team/company by reflecting on past experiences.
* Start gathering the building blocks of information you will need to craft your resume, LinkedIn profile, and elevator pitch in your future job search.

## Overview

“Stories define us. To know someone well is to know their story—the experiences that have shaped them, the trials and turning points that have tested them. Seldom is a good story so needed, though, as when a major change of professional direction is under way. In a time of such an unnerving transition, telling a compelling story inspires belief in our motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals we’ve set.”

As you read this, take a minute to think about the incredible step you have taken. You are in the process of learning web development; a brand new way to communicate with the world, and attaining the skills needed to develop meaningful and impactful products. The real question is: How did you get here? What twists and turns led you to make this decision? What inspired you? These are the answers that are going to be a critical part of your career journey. From drafting a resume, building an online presence, networking, interviewing, and meeting tons of amazing people - you need to figure out how to craft your story. Your entire career trajectory has led to choosing to learn how to code. This means all that led here is valid and important. Your story till this moment informs your current narrative and enriches it. Own your story.

Think about your favorite stories. What makes them compelling? What makes them great? They generally have a protagonist (you), they provide some background on the character (where you are coming from, what you have done up until this point), and an element of drama (is the main character unhappy, unfulfilled, fighting some type of battle?).

“Not only do transition stories have all the elements of a classic tale, but they have the most important ones in spades. Notice what moves a story along. It’s change, conflict, tension, discontinuity. What hooks us in a movie or novel is the turning point, the break with the past, the fact that the world has changed in some intriguing and fascinating way that will force the protagonist to discover and reveal who he truly is. If those elements are missing, the story will be flat.”

Everyone has a story to tell, including you. We are here to help you identify what makes you unique, and what makes your story interesting. Let’s start thinking about your journey: past, present, and future.
